## Memory Optimization Features

This application includes several optimizations to minimize memory usage:

1. **Virtualized UI**: Only visible thumbnails consume memory resources
2. **LRU Cache**: Least Recently Used cache system automatically frees memory  
3. **Downscaled Loading**: Large images are decoded at reduced resolution
4. **Lazy Loading**: Thumbnails are generated only when needed
5. **Proper Resource Disposal**: Implements IDisposable pattern 
6. **Explicit GC Control**: Strategic garbage collection to minimize memory pressure
7. **Background Processing**: All heavy operations run in background threads

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- .NET 6.0 or higher

## Usage

1. Click "Select PNG Folder" to browse your directories
2. Click on any thumbnail to open the image viewer
3. Use the toolbar buttons to manipulate the image:
